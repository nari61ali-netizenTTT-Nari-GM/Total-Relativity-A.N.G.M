      <h3>Preface – Tensor One</h3>
      <p>
        From the perspective of space, all quantities are one. Numbers and measures have no true place in the universe. 
        If you assign a number, it is always 1. In fact, only two numbers exist as qualities, not quantities: 0 and 1. 
        Space without 1, and 1 without space, together form Space–Matter. Every other number arises from cycles of qualitative symmetry.
        This is the machine of Tensor One.

      <h3>New Discoveries in Physics</h3>
      <p>
        Density, pressure, and gravity cannot be fully understood without Archimedes. 
        He showed that a body immersed in fluid experiences buoyancy equal to the displaced fluid’s weight. 
        Conservation of energy and matter must begin here, not only with Einstein or Hawking.
      </p>
      <pre>
M = V + G
D = P / M
G = P × M
V = M - G
E = V × G
P = G / M
Matter = V/D + M²
      </pre>
      <p>
        Pressure belongs to space. Density and gravity both arise from pressure. Rotation stabilizes pressure, 
        just as shaking milk in a churn makes cheese, or stirring coffee creates foam.
      </p>

      <h3>Cosmic Scale Calculation</h3>
      <p>
        The fastest stable rotation known is the spin of galaxies in the Laniakea cluster, 
        at 2,160,000 km/h. This rotation is driven by pressure from the spinning dimension of space itself.
      </p>

      <h3>Density Defined</h3>
      <p>
        Density is the mirror image of gravity in pressure. Gravity and density are two opposing forces. 
        In space, they keep bodies in orbit. Without density, gravity could not form stable matter interactions.
      </p>

      <h3>Gravity vs. Attraction</h3>
      <p>
        Gravity is not weight-dependent. It is the concentration of force in the energy field of matter, 
        shaped by spatial pressure. It is not “curvature of space” but geometric intensity of energy.
      </p>

      <h3>Black Hole Discovery</h3>
      <p>
        By comparing the lightest material, carbon aerogel (Ͽ), with a black hole, 
        I calculated the pressure and density of a black hole. The event horizon is the only natural place 
        where a perfect sphere exists.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Final Geometric–Pressure Equation</h3>
      <pre>
G = 360° × (1 - (D × P)/π)
      </pre>
      <p>
        Only when D × P = π does matter reach perfect spherical singularity.  
        π is not density or pressure, but the universal curvature constant.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h3>Implications of π</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Universal reference for complete curvature.</li>
        <li>Precise comparison between materials.</li>
        <li>Boundary between ordinary matter and black-hole geometry.</li>
        <li>Bridge between geometry and physics.</li>
        <li>Simple teaching tool for complex concepts.</li>
        <li>Artifact for global registration.</li>
        <li>Every material becomes a witness of geometric reality.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        π stabilizes the universal reference for curvature.  
        It allows comparison, teaching, and registration.  
        It transforms matter into a witness of reality.  
        Physics has been rewritten in simple, beautiful language, 
        so parents can tell its wonders to their children as bedtime stories.
