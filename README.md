★ From the perspective of space, all quantities are one quantity. Numbers and magnitudes in the universe have no inherent meaning or position. Yet if you wish to assign a number to that quantity, that number is equal to 1. Every quantity in our universe is equal to 1. In principle, if you are within this universe and want to assign a number, there are only two numbers. These two are qualities, not quantities: (0 and 1). Space without the one quantity, and the one quantity without space—together they form spacematter. Beyond this, any other number you find and count in the universe belongs to cycles of qualitative symmetry, produced by space and the one quantity of matter. If you perceive them as precise, balanced, and harmonious—or if they appear wondrous—it is the result of qualitative symmetries made possible in the spacematter symmetry machine.
